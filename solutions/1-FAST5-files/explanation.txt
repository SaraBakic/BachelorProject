In this part of Phase1 I had to complete 3 different tasks regarding FAST5 files.

Python script for the first task is located in "parseRawSignals.py" and the png plots are all located in folder "pngs".

Answer to the second task is in "parseBasecalledSignals.py" where I parsed the basecalled signals and noticed some additional info that I printed.

In the third task I had to compare guppy basecalled signals with already basecalled signals and find the differences. All regarding this task is located in "guppy_basecalled_compare" folder. Guppy basecaller had created two .fastq files, a .log file, a "sequencing_summary.txt" file and a "sequencing_telemetry.js" file. The last two files left in the folder are "compareGuppy.py" and "diff.txt" and those are my work. In "compareGuppy.py" I compare the sequences in the two different types of basecalled signals and in "diff.txt" are the outputed differences.
